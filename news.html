	    <p>NASA astronauts Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley will make history later this month: On their next mission, slated to take off May 27, they will be the first crew to fly in SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule.
	      The flight has been years in the making, and it will mark several other firsts: The first time astronauts have flown to the International Space Station from US soil since NASA retired the Space Shuttle Program in 2011; the first-ever crewed mission for SpaceX in its 18-year history; and the first time since 1981 that NASA astronauts will ride aboard a newly-designed spacecraft. </p>

	    <p>Apple is gearing up to open its US stores to customers again, nearly two months after the coronavirus pandemic forced them shut.
	      The company said Friday that it will reopen some retail outlets next week across four states â€” Idaho, South Carolina, Alabama and Alaska. Apple (AAPL) did not reveal how many stores will reopen, but it has a total of six stores across the four states. The first store to reopen will be in Boise, Idaho, on Monday.
  "We've missed our customers and look forward to offering our support," a company spokesperson said in a statement provided to CNN Business. The news was first reported by CNBC.
	      Apple will primarily focus on its Genius Bar, which provides in-person service and tech support, as more people use its products to stay connected while working from home, the spokesperson added. </p>
